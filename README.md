# CIST4B1_AdvJava
A repository to document my Java learning journey

About Me
I have been learning programming since 2020. I have learned a little bit of Java, C++ and Python, but not good at each one of them. In my free time i love cooking and watching comedies and suspense movies. 

Goals for This Course
Hope through this course, i can be really good at Java and the data structure and have no problem doing leetcode and can get an internship soon.
